@salvatore51 @StapeNewsday That's assuming Garth is there for the length of 55's contract. No guarantee of that. 55 prob wouldn't chance it

@KeithLHHockey I'm also hoping this is true. Garth/isles have to be owed at least a little favor for keeping him relevant in the NHL.

@HaberMetrics5 multi-year... lol, it's TWO years! And depending on trades, we need d-men to expose to expansion draft.
