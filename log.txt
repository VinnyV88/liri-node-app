@salvatore51 @StapeNewsday That's assuming Garth is there for the length of 55's contract. No guarantee of that. 55 prob wouldn't chance it

@StapeNewsday What is your logic behind this? opt-out is 3 yrs away, no? Is there another opt-out? Or assuming can get out via other method?

@KeithLHHockey I'm also hoping this is true. Garth/isles have to be owed at least a little favor for keeping him relevant in the NHL.
